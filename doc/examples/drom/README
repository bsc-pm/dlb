This is a small example of the DLB DROM module.

Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`.

Execution
---------
Simply run the binary 'drom_01' and use the 'dlb_taskset' command to modify
the number of threads of the application. It is recommended to use two
terminal windows to differentiate the output of each program.

You can also play with two or more processes at the same time, but remember
that the new process need some available CPUs. Remove some CPUs from the
other processes or run with 'dlb_taskset' to let DLB manage the CPU stealing.

Example (one process)
---------------------
$ ./drom_01
...
# In another terminal
$ dlb_taskset -l                # list shared memory info
$ dlb_taskset -p <pid> -c 0,1   # Assign CPUs 0-1 to process <pid>

Example (many processes)
------------------------
$ ./drom_01                     # Inital mask: 0-7
...
# Manually remove CPUs 4-7 and start another process
$ dlb_taskset -r 4-7
$ taskset -c 4-7 ./drom_01
...
# Start another process using dlb_taskset and let DLB manage the CPU stealing
$ dlb_taskset -c 3,7 ./drom_01
...
# List shared memory
$ dlb_taskset -l
