This is a small example of DLB DROM module

Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`.

Execution
---------
Simply run the binary 'drom_01' and use the 'dlb_taskset' command to modify
the number of threads of the application. It is recommended to use two
terminal windows to differentiate the output of each program.

Example
-------
$ ./drom_01
...
# In another terminal
$ dlb_taskset -l                # list shared memory info
$ dlb_taskset -p <pid> -c 0,1   # Assign CPUs 0-1 to process <pid>
