This a small example of the DLB Barrier function.

Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`.

Note that two binaries are generated: 'app' and 'app_barrier'. The latter is
linked with '-ldlb_instr' for the sake of the example. If tracing is not
intended you may safely use '-ldlb'.

Execution
---------
Open the file 'run.sh' and edit any option of flag necessary. The script
assumes OpenMPI and a system with 8 CPUs where hardware threads are treated as
CPUs.  You may have to change the number of ranks or any other MPI option
depending on your system.

Launch the 'run.sh' script to execute an emulation of a coupled application.
Only processes with the same coupling id (the first parameter) will compute at
the same time. When all of them reach the barrier, the other processes will
start.

For tracing, edit the variable TRACE=1, make sure EXTRAE_HOME is set and run as
usual.
