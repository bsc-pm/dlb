This is a small example of an MPI+OMP application running optionally with DLB.

Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`.

Execution
---------
Ideally, executing the script 'run.sh' should be enough. Although depending on your MPI
implementation, you may need to add or modify some specific mpirun flags for either
setting the LD_PRELOAD variable or to correctly bind processes to CPUs. This
example runs DLB without mask support, so make sure that each MPI is running without
CPU binding. Modify the variable MPIEXEC_NOBIND_FLAG if needed. Some common flags are
'--bind-to none' for OpenMPI or '-binding none' for Intel MPI.

You can change the values of DLB and TRACE variables to modify the script behaviour.
By default both options are set to 0, which means that the example program will run
without DLB nor tracing capabilities. Setting DLB to 1 should enable DLB to perform
some basic balancing techniques. And setting TRACE to 1 will enable the tracing
through the EXTRAE tracing library. The TRACE options assumes that you have EXTRAE
correctly installed, and your environment variable EXTRAE_HOME points to that path.
This option will generate a tracefile.prv which can be opened using the PARAVER
application.
