NOTE: The module 'statistics' is currently deprecated and not supported.

This is a small example of DLB Statistics module

Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`. The Makefile assumes you
have the Mercurium binaries directory in your PATH.

Execution
---------
The 'run.sh' script is configured to run an MPI+OmpSs binary for a long time. This is
useful to give some time to play from other processes while we read some statistics.
After that, feel free to kill (Ctrl-C) the process.

While the application is running, you can run the two small programs:
 * 'get_pid_list' will list the processes attached to the DLB Statistics module that
   are running on the node
 * 'get_cpu_usage' requires a PID as an argument. It will print the cpu usage of the
   given process until it's finished or killed.

Another option is to use the ${DLB_PREFIX}/dlb_cpu_usage GUI tool that allows you to
see in real time some statistics of the processes you wish.


* NOTE *
To run dlb_cpu_usage on MareNostrum you need to load the following modules:
module load intel
module load mkl
module load PYTHON/2.7.6
