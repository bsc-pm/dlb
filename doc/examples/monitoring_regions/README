======

This is a small example of TALP gathering data from an MPI application. The
application does not need to be linked with DLB, although it is necessary if
using user-defined Monitoring Regions. For this reason, this application is
compiled in two different ways, one without DLB, and another one using the
TALP API and linked with DLB.

Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`.

Execution
---------
* Edit the script 'run.sh'
    * Check that the variables detected at configure time are correct
    * Review the variables to be modified by the user and change them as you like

* Run the script 'run.sh'
* Review the results

By default, the script runs the original version of the application, the one
that does not define custom regions. You can change the values of
USER_DEFINED_REGIONS to 1 to use the other application and see the added value.
