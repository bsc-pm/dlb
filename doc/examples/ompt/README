This is a simple test to check whether DLB can register as an OpenMP Tool for
the current OpenMP runtime.


Compilation
-----------
Check that the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`.

Execution
---------
Simply run the `run.sh` script and notice whether DLB can or cannot be
registered as an OpenMP Tool. If DLB is successfully registered, you will see
some version information about the OpenMP runtime and other verbose messages
from DLB.  Otherwise, the program will report that it did not succeed.

Notice that the Makefile is configured to use the C compiler detected during
the DLB installation, but you do not need to compile your applications with the
same compiler.  At the time of writing, GCC's libgomp still does not support
OMPT so you may need to change to Intel or Clang compilers in order to use an
OMPT capable OpenMP runtime library.

Example
-------
$ make CC=gcc
$ ./run.sh
...
DLB has not been initialized through OpenMP.
...

-------
$ make CC=clang
$ ./run.sh
...
DLB has correctly been registered as an OpenMP Tool.
