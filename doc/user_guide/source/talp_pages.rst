TALP-Pages
******************************************************

TALP-Pages is a suite of tools that allows the postprocessing of JSON files generated by :ref:`TALP<talp>`. 
Additionally, it provides some scripts to allow for an easy integration into CI/CD setups to continuously monitor a codes performance tightly coupled to the development workflow.

The main goal was to have a set of script that easily allows teams to monitor their applications performance and identify potential bottlenecks easily.


.. warning::
    Please be aware, that TALP-Pages is still an experimental feature that is introduced in the 3.5.0 release.

.. note::
    Were currently working on extending this documentation.

Installation
=============

To install TALP-Pages, you can use an python package manger that can access the `PyPI repository <https://pypi.org/project/talp-pages/>`_. 
With ``pip`` you can install TALP-Pages like:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install talp-pages


.. note::
    
    We currently require a Python version > 3.9 and test the package up to 3.12

Overview
=========================

After installation you have access to the ``talp`` command which currently has 3 different features implemented:

- ``ci-report`` will generate a performance report in HTML from the input path of json files provided. 
- ``metadata`` will read in enviroment variables available in different CI solutions and enrich the generated json with additional git-related information.
- ``download-gitlab`` will download artifacts from previous jobs. This is an essential tool to track the applications performance over time.

Folder structure
============================

TALP-Pages needs your ``.json`` files obtained through :ref:`TALP <talp>` to be in a folder structure similar to the tree output shown below.

.. code-block:: bash

    .
    `-- talp
        |-- mesh_1
        |   |-- comparison_of_rc
        |   |   |-- talp_1x112.json
        |   |   |-- talp_2x56.json
        |   |   `-- talp_4x28.json
        |   |-- strong_scaling
        |   |   |-- talp_8x14.json
        |   |   `-- talp_8x28.json
        |   `-- weak_scaling
        |       |-- talp_8x14.json
        |       `-- talp_8x28.json
        `-- mesh_2
            |-- strong_scaling
            |   |-- talp_8x14.json
            |   `-- talp_8x28.json
            `-- weak_scaling
                |-- talp_8x14.json
                `-- talp_8x28.json

With this folder structure you can generate a report like: 

.. code-block:: bash

    talp ci-report -i ./talp -o output
        

I want to use TALP-Pages on my laptop
==========================================

If you just did a scaling experiment with the code youre trying to analyze, you can also use TALP-Pages to generate HTML report you can view with any browser locally. 



I want to use TALP-Pages in GitLab CI
==========================================

In order to use TALP-Pages in a `GitLab CI <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/>`_ enviroment the following how-to-guide assumes the following prerequisites:

- The machine you want to run your application on has some way to interface with a `GitLab runner <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/index.html>`_. (Don't worry if you don't have `Jacamar <https://gitlab.com/ecp-ci/jacamar-ci>`_. Normally no sudo rights are required to run the gitlab-runner on the login node.)
- The machine you want to run your code in has a ``DLB`` :ref:`installation<dlb-installation>`. Optimally with ``PAPI`` support. 
- Your GitLab instance has the `GitLab Pages <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/>`_ feature activated
- Optionally already have some coarse-grain code annotations in place. 
- Your code is using MPI or OpenMP or both and is primarely running on CPUs.
- Your code is written in C/C++ or Fortran

For an example workflow you can have a look at our `repository <https://pm.bsc.es/gitlab/dlb/talp-pages-example>`_
