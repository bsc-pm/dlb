TALP-Pages
******************************************************

TALP-Pages is a suite of tools that allows the post-processing of JSON files generated by :ref:`TALP<talp>`. 
Additionally, it provides some scripts to allow for an easy integration into CI/CD setups to continuously monitor a code's performance, tightly coupled to the development workflow.

The main goal was to provide a set of scripts that enable teams to easily monitor their application's performance and quickly identify potential bottlenecks.


.. note::
    With the release of DLB 3.6.0 we also provide support for GPU runs in TALP-Pages.

.. warning::
    Please, be aware that TALP-Pages is still an experimental feature that is introduced in the 3.5.0 release.

.. note::
    We are currently working on extending this documentation.

Installation
=============

To install TALP-Pages, you can use an python package manger that can access the `PyPI repository <https://pypi.org/project/talp-pages/>`_. 
With ``pip`` you can install TALP-Pages like:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install talp-pages


.. note::

    We currently require a Python version >= 3.9 for executing and >= 3.12 for testing.

Overview
=========================

After installation you have access to the ``talp`` command which currently has 3 different features implemented:

- ``ci-report`` will generate a performance report in HTML from the input path of JSON files provided. 
- ``metadata`` will read in environment variables available in different CI solutions and enrich the generated JSON with additional git-related information.
- ``download-gitlab`` will download artifacts from previous jobs. This is an essential tool to track the applications performance over time.

Folder structure
============================

TALP-Pages needs your ``.json`` files obtained through :ref:`TALP <talp>` to be in a folder structure similar to the tree output shown below.

.. code-block:: bash

    .
    `-- talp
        |-- mesh_1
        |   |-- comparison_of_rc
        |   |   |-- talp_1x112.json
        |   |   |-- talp_2x56.json
        |   |   `-- talp_4x28.json
        |   |-- strong_scaling
        |   |   |-- talp_8x14.json
        |   |   `-- talp_8x28.json
        |   `-- weak_scaling
        |       |-- talp_8x14.json
        |       `-- talp_8x28.json
        `-- mesh_2
            |-- strong_scaling
            |   |-- talp_8x14.json
            |   `-- talp_8x28.json
            `-- weak_scaling
                |-- talp_8x14.json
                `-- talp_8x28.json

With this folder structure you can generate a report like: 

.. code-block:: bash

    talp ci-report -i ./talp -o output


I want to use TALP-Pages on my laptop
==========================================

If you just did a scaling experiment with the code you're trying to analyze, you can also use TALP-Pages to generate HTML report you can view with any browser locally. 



I want to use TALP-Pages in my CI/CD framework
===============================================

We currently provide example implementations for `GitLab CI <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/>`_ and for `GitHub Actions. <https://github.com/features/actions>`_

There are some prerequisites your application needs to fulfill, that are independent of the CI framework used:

- The machine you want to run your code in has a ``DLB`` :ref:`installation<dlb-installation>`. Optimally with ``PAPI`` support. 
- Your code is using MPI or OpenMP or both and is primarily running on CPUs.
- Your code is written in C/C++ or Fortran
- Optionally already have some coarse-grain code annotations in place. 


GitLab 
--------

In order to use TALP-Pages in a `GitLab CI <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/>`_ environment you should fullfill some additional requirements:

- The machine you want to run your application on has some way to interface with a `GitLab runner <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/index.html>`_. (Don't worry if you don't have `Jacamar <https://gitlab.com/ecp-ci/jacamar-ci>`_. Normally no sudo rights are required to run the gitlab-runner on the login node.)
- Your GitLab instance has the `GitLab Pages <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/>`_ feature activated

For an example workflow you can have a look at our `repository <https://pm.bsc.es/gitlab/dlb/talp-pages-example>`_


GitHub 
--------

In order to use TALP-Pages in a `GitHub Actions. <https://github.com/features/actions>`_ environment you should fulfill some additional requirements:

- The machine you want to run your application on has some way to interface with a `self hosted GitHub runner <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/concepts/runners/self-hosted-runners>`_. Normally no sudo rights are required to run the GitHub runner.
- Note, that the available GitHub runners don't provide access to hardware counters, so we recommend using a self-hosted runner.

For an example workflow you can have a look at our `repository <https://pm.bsc.es/gitlab/dlb/talp-pages-example>`_
